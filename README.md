# Covid19-Analysis-and-Visualization

## üìñ Project Overview
The **Covid19-Analysis-and-Visualization** project uses data analysis and visualization techniques to analyze the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in India. This project focuses on creating visualizations to highlight important observations made during the analysis of COVID-19 data.



The project includes various analyses and visualizations, such as the cumulative number of cases, total positive cases in each age group, state-wise distribution, and other critical COVID-19 statistics in India.
